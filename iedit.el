;;; Commentary:

;; This package is an Emacs minor mode and allows you to edit one occurrence of
;; some text in a buffer (possibly narrowed) or region, and simultaneously have
;; other occurrences edited in the same way.
;;
;; Normal scenario of iedit-mode is like:
;;
;; - Highlight certain contents - by press C-;
;;   All occurrences of a symbol, string or a rectangle in the buffer or a
;;   region may be highlighted corresponding to current mark, point and prefix
;;   argument.  Refer to the document of `iedit-mode' for details.
;;
;; - Edit one of the occurrences
;;   The change is applied to other occurrences simultaneously.
;;
;; - Finish - by pressing C-; again
;;
;; This package also provides rectangle support with *visible rectangle*
;; highlighting, which is similar with cua mode rectangle support, but still
;; quite different.

;; You can also use Iedit mode as a quick way to temporarily show only the
;; buffer lines that match the current text being edited.  This gives you the
;; effect of a temporary `keep-lines' or `occur'.  To get this effect, hit C-'
;; when in Iedit mode - it toggles hiding non-matching lines.
;;
;; Renaming refactoring is convenient in Iedit mode
;;
;; - The symbol under point is selected as occurrence by default and only
;;   complete symbols are matched
;; - With digit prefix argument 0, only symbols in current function are matched
;; - Restricting symbols in current region can be done by pressing C-; again
;; - Last renaming refactoring is remembered and can be applied to other buffers
;;   later
;;
;; There are also some other facilities you may never think about.  Refer to the
;; document of function `iedit-mode' (C-h f iedit-mode RET) for more details.

;; The code was developed and fully tested on Gnu Emacs 24.0.93, partially
;; tested on Gnu Emacs 22. If you have any compatible problem, please let me
;; know.

;;; todo:
;; - Add more easy access keys for whole occurrence

;;; Contributors
;; Adam Lindberg <eproxus@gmail.com> added a case sensitivity option that can be toggled.

;; Tassilo Horn <tassilo@member.fsf.org> added an option to match only complete
;; words, not inside words

;; Le Wang <l26wang@gmail.com> proposed to match only complete symbols,  not
;; inside symbols, contributed rectangle support

  "Toggle Iedit mode.
This command behaves differently, depending on the mark, point,
prefix argument and variable `iedit-transient-mark-sensitive'.

If Iedit mode is off, turn Iedit mode on.

When Iedit mode is turned on, all the occurrences of the current
region in the buffer (possibly narrowed) or a region are
highlighted.  If one occurrence is modified, the change are
propagated to all other occurrences simultaneously.

If region is not active, the current symbol (returns from
`current-word') is used as the occurrence by default.  The
occurrences of the current symbol, but not include occurrences
that are part of other symbols, are highlighted.  If you still
want to match all the occurrences, even though they are parts of
other symbols, you may have to mark the symbol first.

In the above two situations, with digit prefix argument 0, only
occurrences in current function are matched.  This is good for
renaming refactoring in programming.

You can also switch to Iedit mode from isearch mode directly. The
current search string is used as occurrence.  All occurrences of
the current search string are highlighted.

With an universal prefix argument, the occurrence when Iedit mode
is turned off last time in current buffer is used as occurrence.
This is intended to recover last Iedit mode which is turned off.
If region active, Iedit mode is limited within the current
region.

With repeated universal prefix argument, the occurrence when
Iedit mode is turned off last time (might be in other buffer) is used
as occurrence.  If region active, Iedit mode is limited within
the current region.

If Iedit mode is on and region is active, Iedit mode is
restricted in the region, e.g. the occurrences outside of the region
is excluded.

If Iedit mode is on and region is active, with an universal
prefix argument, Iedit mode is restricted outside of the region,
e.g. the occurrences in the region is excluded.

Turn off Iedit mode in other situations.
